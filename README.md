PolyDraw is an early work in progress high-quality 2D rendering library written in Rust.

Initial features:

* Path, text and shapes drawing and blending
* Real anti-aliasing, based on computational geometry algorithms
* Sub-pixel rasterization support
* CPU and GPU rasterization implementations
* Linux, Windows and Mac OS X support

The project is still in a proof of concept state with around 10 000 lines of Rust code currently.
