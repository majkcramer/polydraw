PolyDraw is an early work-in-progress high-quality 2D graphics library written in Rust.

Initial features will include:

* Shapes and text drawing and blending
* Highest quality anti-aliasing
* Sub-pixel rasterization support
* Multithreaded CPU rasterization
* Linux, Windows and Mac OS X support

An OpenCL GPU rasterization implmentation will follow after the initial release.

The project is still in a proof-of-concept state with around 10 000 lines of Rust code currently. We are planning for an initial release in Q2 of 2016.
